Darkadan had added the GloomyFurniture texture to sulusdacor's Round Tables.

This is an update of Darkadan's version to Rimworld 1.1. You don't need SD Round Rables for this mod, but if you put this after SD Round Tables in your mod list then this gloomy version will replace the original version.

The beauty values seem a bit high to me but I left them alone. You can easily change them in the xml if you want.

--- Original Description ---
	
Just a little patch:
	
Now textures of the round tables like the GloomyFurniture table's texture and the beautiful rate too.
	
Load after [sd] round tables mod!
	
table small(round) - Beauty 5 wood 25
table(round) - Beauty 5 wood 50
table big(round) - Beauty 10 wood 100
